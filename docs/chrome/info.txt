Activation
----------

The Firebug Lite activation scheme is very simple. When you first visit a web page, Firebug icon will be gray, indicating that it is deactivated. Clicking on it will activate Firebug for all pages in that domain, and the icon will become orange.

Next time you visit a page in that domain, Firebug will be automatically active, and the UI will be open or minimized according to the last time you used it.

To deactivate for a particular domain, go to a page in that domain, and click on the "off" button. Since Firebug Lite uses localStorage to store the activation info, when you clear your browser's cache, Firebug will be deactivated for all pages.
